My portfolio
============

My portfolio page created during Junior Front-end Developer bootcamp at infoShare Academy (Jan-Mar 2017). It is still developed, so be sure to stop by from time to time :) Just go to: https://kjakubcewicz.github.io/strona-o-mnie/



Inspired by Material Design.

No Bootstrap. Optimized for Google Chrome only (for now) and devices of 320px width (or more)

Beautiful hamburger menu thanks to Erik Terwan: http://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP
